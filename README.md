# Application-for-collecting-information-about-football-competitions
It is a copy of orginal private repository. The aim of the project was to develop a database to collect information about football matches, as well as to create a graphical interface to support the above database.
The project was created together with a second student and comes from a database subject.

To create the project we used the following technologies and applications:
* SceneBuilder – application GUI design
* JavaFx library – to support the above graphical interface
* Java – as the main application language
* Oracle 11G2 XE Database – for data collection, Oracle database was imposed from above, we chose the above version due to low hardware requirements.

The SQL folder contains code based on Oracle database.
The GUI folder contains the code of the prepared user interface.
The PASS folder contains the recommended data for implementing the database.
